//! # The HarTex Base Library
//!
//! The HarTex Base Library is the foundation of the entire HarTex bot. It is the glue between
//! various libraries that the bot utilises often, and the functionalities of the bot itself.
//!
//! The base library is *minimal*. It only re-exports some commonly-used libraries used throughout
//! the codebase (often gated behind feature flags to avoid redundant exports); while also
//! providing various primitive types and sometimes extensions to The Rust Standard Library.
//!
//! ## Feature Flags
//!
//! ### `twilight-bundled`
//!
//! This feature flag enables the bundling of the `twilight-*` ecosystem libraries within the base
//! library. This feature is off by default.
//!
//! To enable this feature, add the following line in your `Cargo.toml` file:
//! ```toml
//! hartex_base = { git = "https://github.com/HarTexTeam/HarTex-rust-discord-bot.git", features = [ "twilight-bundled" ] }
//! ```
//!
//! ### `tracing-bundled`
//!
//! This feature flag enables the bundling of the `tracing` and `tracing_subscriber` libraries
//! within the base library. This feature is off by default.
//!
//! To enable this feature, add the following line in your `Cargo.toml` file:
//! ```toml
//! hartex_base = { git = "https://github.com/HarTexTeam/HarTex-rust-discord-bot.git", features = [ "tracing-bundled" ] }
//! ```
