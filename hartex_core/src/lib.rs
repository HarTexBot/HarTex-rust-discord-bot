//! # `hartex_core` - The `HarTex` Core Library
//!
//! The `hartex_core` library contains the core functionality for the `HarTex` Discord bot.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - `twilight-bundled`: bundles most of the `twilight` ecosystem of crates with the library,
//!                       removes the need to include the dependencies repeatedly across the
//!                       `HarTex` crates.
//!
//! - `tracing-bundled`: bundles tracing, a logging library for use within the `HarTex` crates.
